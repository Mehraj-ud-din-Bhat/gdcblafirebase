<button class="accordion">&#10070;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>There is no denying the fact that present age is the age of information and our economy is largely knowledge based economy. Postmodern age is the age of digits, of bytes and of communication networks and here, we are what we are able to present ourselves. Our identity is manifested by our image in the world of web. We don’t matter if we can’t be googled. To have existence, an institution has to be framed by Information & Communication Technology (ICT) or it doesn’t count. As such website of an institution and its continuous up- gradation is among the most important academically fruitful tools for dissemination of information to the wider public in general and students in particular.<br>

Education, in real terms is not about competing and learning certain tricks but about gaining knowledge and then to translate it into wisdom and apply it in building a value based life. It moulds and transforms a raw person into a character that distinguishes good from evil. There is no doubt that students in this century of shifting values face pressure from teachers as well as parents. This pressure at times can lead to disastrous consequences. The most important cause is the over emphasis on grades and percentages. Teachers as well as parents fail to lay emphasis on values. In this era of consumerism, educational institutions have to strive for preserving and protecting the social fabric and the teachers have to be the role models, even during the hard times, other wise human race shall loose its significance. It is in this backdrop, that we, at Government College Baramulla seek to find and discover a newer world, full of responsibility, tolerance, compassion, humility and self-discipline.<br>

In addition to the teaching of varied subjects, we strive to instil faith and confidence in students to look beyond themselves. It would give us great joy if we are able to train the younger generations how to face the future; and if we are able to teach them how to focus on their goals. We intend to teach how to respect ourselves and respect others. All this we can achieve with love and kindness. In short we dream of providing holistic education. Inshallah, with the blessings of Allah we can achieve our set goal<br>

Courses were designed to take care of both the classical and contemporary aspects of physics. What makes the physics experience at Govt Degree College Baramulla special, over and above the syllabus, are : the dedication of its teachers, the quality of its students, and the unique atmosphere of the college. At their best our teachers require their students to learn honestly, think independently, recognize quality, and develop the confidence to create rather than merely reproduce. At their best our students keep their teachers and one another on their feet. The quality of the students gives the teachers the freedom to go beyond the confines of the syllabus, whether in practical matters like computational physics and error analysis, growth of crystals or recondite matters like path integrals in quantum mechanics. Students do projects to explore areas off the charted path. Teachers and students alike work hard and think hard. And yet, there is an atmosphere of joyful camaraderie in the department. Though the pressure of tests and projects cannot be denied, it is not relentless : there is time enough for discussion and dreaming, for participation in extra-curricular activities, and for fun and fellowship. In keeping with College's tradition physics students get a lot of personal attention from teachers, an important source of encouragement and guidance.

Today it is one of the foremost departments of English Literature in Kashmir Valley and its alumni occupy senior positions in academia, adminstration and other services in and outside the country

<br>As English language and literature forms a common component of all the faculties.Teaching has always been a high priority for the Department, with a good deal of contact between students and teachers. Faculty are free to design courses and in recent years they have offered courses in new fields such as (among others), popular culture and music, Western attitudes to the 'Orient', aspects of the Renaissance, queer theory, history of the book, aboriginal and settler colony literatures, editing, textual criticism, postcolonial studies, drama and creative writing. Some of the courses include practical training as well as lecture-based teaching. While the urge to excel is high, and the burden of coursework can be quite heavy, students are also given guidance and mentoring and a good deal of freedom to use their initiative in their work. This prepares them for competitive careers in their chosen fields after they graduate.

<br>The Department also focuses on research and has a fairly large population of M.Phil and Ph.D. scholars who bring an inquiring edge to the Department's preoccupations. Inter college and inter university level seminars are held two or three times a year and senior scholars and faculty present papers alongside delegates from all over the valley.
